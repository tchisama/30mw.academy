how to comment a code in rust , 
you can do that by using `//` for single line comment and `/* */` for multi line comment

```rust
// single line comment
fn main() {
    // this is a single line comment
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

```

```rust
/* multi line comment
fn main() {
    // this is a multi line comment
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
*/
```
