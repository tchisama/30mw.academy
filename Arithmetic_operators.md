# Arithmetic operators in rust


## what are arithmetic operators ?



arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations.

example :

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    let sum = a + b;
    let sub = a - b;
    let mul = a * b;
    let div = a / b;
    let rem = a % b;
    println!("sum : {}", sum);
    println!("sub : {}", sub);
    println!("mul : {}", mul);
    println!("div : {}", div);
    println!("rem : {}", rem);
}
```
